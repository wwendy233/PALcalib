# Panoramic Annular Lens (PAL) Camera Calibration

This repository accompanies the paper:

> **Improved Calibration for Panoramic Annular Lens Systems with Angular Modulation**

We propose a novel calibration model that explicitly incorporates angular modulation (`h`) in PAL systems, achieving sub-pixel accuracy with fewer distortion terms.

## Datasets

Some of datasets used in our experiments are hosted on Baidu Drive due to size constraints:
