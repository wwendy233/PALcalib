# PALcalib

This toolbox implements a novel calibration framework tailored for Panoramic Annular Lens (PAL) systems, which feature unique projection characteristics due to their blind-zone compression design. It incorporates angular modulation modeling to better capture the imaging process of PAL cameras. The toolbox supports accurate parameter estimation, high-order distortion correction, and asymmetric distortion modeling. 

The toolbox is currently under preparation for open-source release. Thank you for your understanding and patience!
